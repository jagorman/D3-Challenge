          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>
          <p> When we compare a State's median age to the percentage of its smokers, there seems to be no correlation between the two. 
             The chart shows that lower median age States are no more likely to have a higher percentage of smokers than states with a higher median age.
          </p>
          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>  
          <p>What became apparent is that the six States with the highest percentage of smokers are located in the southeastern part of the United States. 
            We wonder if the rest of the data showed higher rates of poverty, obesity and therefore lower healthcare rates as well.
          </p>
          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>
          <p>We also noted that among the five states with the lowest percentage of smokers, three of them (CA, NY and TX) are also the highest populated States in the country. 
            More data is needed to understand why this is so, but it would be interesting to know if there is something else that is causing this.
